# The premise of the game is to progress through increasingly more difficult levels trying to score a touchdown
# as a UVA football quarterback. The user plays as a quarterback that passes a ball to a receiver that strafes left and
# right. There will be defenders/enemies that players avoid in order to score a touchdown and progress to more levels.
# Every time they throw a pass to a defender they lose health until they run out and the game will end.

# User Input: We will incorporate user input by having push the arrows on the keyboard to move around. The Key
# 'F' allows the user to pass a ball. They will also have to hit the space bar in order to start the game and
# try again after the game ends.

# Game over: Once a player runs out of health the game will be over.
# Graphics and Images: We have many graphics and images including original pixel art.

# Graphics/Images: The start screen has pictures of UVA football players, and when the game actually starts, there are
# multiple hand-drawn images of pixel art players and defenders. There is also a football field as a game background.


# Additional Features:
# We will have a restart from game over screen. Once the user loses a heart, there is a try again screen that prompts
# the user to press space to continue. Once the user runs out of health, they get a game over screen, and are prompted
# to press space to restart. Once they do so, they return to level 1 and everything is reset.

# We have a health bar. This is incorporated by having 3 hearts in the bottom left corner of the screen that will tell
# the player how many lives that they have left. Once one is taken away, a full heart image turns into an empty heart.
# Hearts can be taken away when a passed ball makes contact with a defender.

# We will have multiple levels. This is incorporated by having a level counter in the bottom right of the screen. As the
# user progresses through the levels, the enemies mentioned in the next feature get faster, and there are more enemies.
# The Last enemy will be spawned in on level 5, and any level past level 5 makes the enemies faster.

# We will have enemies. Enemies strafe from left to right acting as an obstacle to avoid when passing a ball to a
# receiver. If the passed ball makes contact with an enemy, the user loses health.

# CHANGES:
# We changed the try again screen and added a game over screen.
