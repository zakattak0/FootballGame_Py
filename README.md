The premise of the game is to progress through increasingly more difficult levels trying to score a touchdown as a UVA football quarterback. The user plays as a quarterback that passes a ball to a receiver that strafes left and right. There will be defenders/enemies that players avoid in order to score a touchdown and progress to more levels. Every time they throw a pass to a defender they lose health until they run out and the game will end.

üïπÔ∏è User Input: Push the arrows on the keyboard to move around. The Key 'F' allows the user to pass a ball. Hit the space bar in order to start the game and try again after the game ends.

üòµ Game over: Once a player runs out of health the game will be over.

üñºÔ∏è Graphics/Images: The start screen has pictures of UVA football players, and when the game actually starts, there are multiple hand-drawn images of pixel art players and defenders. There is also a football field as a game background.
